# fakenews-nn
A neural network model built with Tensorflow Keras to classify fake and real news.

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/rchitic17/real-or-fake

Parts of code for pre-processing were used from the tutorial by Raymond Cheng at https://towardsdatascience.com/lstm-text-classification-using-pytorch-2c6c657f8fc0


## Limitations
Despite the good precision and recall scores on the test dataset, since the model was trained on a small dataset which would render it unusable for any production purpose.
